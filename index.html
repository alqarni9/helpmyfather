<h3>The story of my dad</h3>
    

<p title="info">My father fell seriously ill and needed money: he was in a restaurant buying food for us
    As he spoke to the restaurant cashier, he felt something wrong inside his head and something dangerous was coming. Suddenly his head exploded after that  he didn't see anything completely, and he kept shouting, "What is  happening?" He opened the door of the restaurant while he walk like baby , and he didn't see anything. The sun's rays came to him after that, praise be to God, he began to see, but he was not happy, why because there is a defect in his eye. He did not know what this defect was, and he could not even describe this defect. after that he  leave the restaurant, then he went to the  home and sat at home crying, and he was very depressed psychologically and collapsed until now. This disease occurred in 2017 so far and it is still going on. He was not a genius like my first father. He is a very good person and all people love him and he helps people and he is very nice to me and he didn't tell me that he was in pain and I broke down more and more. He did not find a good source of income, and we are in a serious condition, and my father does not have enough money with him, and he needs money donate us please , and he needs treatment. Help us, help us, may God protect you
  and make you happy and grant you success</p>
